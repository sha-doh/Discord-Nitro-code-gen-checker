_**currently woking on a bug fix (Random Crashes)**_

**Requires latest vesion of Node.js get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/**

**Requires Proxies get them here: http://free-proxy.cz/en/**

Open CMD and use the cd command get the folder open

then run node start

and you're done have fun

if you want to Check specific codes open "codes.txt" file and and add your codes it will check those

to use proxies just add a "proxies.txt" file with your proxies and it should work, if you get errors dont just delete proxies file, make sure they are all valid http, OR just leave the proxies file blank because it needs to be there for the code to run



*P.S.* even tho it generates quickly it might take a while to get a valid code

*P.P.S.* IDK how to do this on imac btw
