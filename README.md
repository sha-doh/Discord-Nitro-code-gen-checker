Requires latest vesion of Node.js get it here https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Open CMD and use the cd command get the folder open

then run node start

and you're done have fun

if you want to Check specific codes add a "codes.txt" file and it will check those

to use proxies just add a "proxies.txt" file with your proxies and it should work, if you get errors just delete proxies file 



P.S. even tho it generates quickly it might take a while to get a valid code

P.P.S. IDK how to do this on imac btw
